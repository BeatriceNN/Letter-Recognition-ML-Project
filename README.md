# Letter-Recognition-ML-Project
Machine learning project for classifying handwritten letters using various algorithms like Random Forest and kNN

The goal is to recognize 26 capital letters from numerical descriptions of black-and-white pixel images.
The dataset is from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  It was donated on the 31st of December, 1990. 
You can clone this repository and run project_15(1).ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab or view it as is.

I already had very good results to begin with for kNN. I do acknowledge that maybe I should not have spent too mcuh time regularising with 
logistic regression given the high log loss I had right from the beginning. The ensemble methods also worked marginally better on the 
dataset.
The best results I saw were with kNN, Random Forest and Extra Trees models.
